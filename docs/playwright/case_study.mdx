# Test Automation Example using Playwright

UITAF is designed with a strong separation of concerns (SOC) and a high level of abstraction, meaning it doesn’t rely on any single test automation framework, making it inherently flexible. To demonstrate this, I created an example integration using Playwright, showing how UITAF can adapt to other Java-based test automation tools. This required a rewrite of the Selenium PageObject factory, as UITAF is ideally suited for the PageObject design pattern introduced by Martin Fowler, while Playwright lacks a built-in PageObject factory. The original [Automation Example](/test_lab/example) was adapted to use Playwright, illustrating how UITAF can smoothly integrate with different test automation frameworks.

This is a work in progress, and once fully developed, I will post additional documentation here. However, the test code is not significantly different from the original. The main change is that the @FindBy annotation and its Selenium variants have been replaced with an @Locate annotation, which accepts the standard argument for Playwright’s locator() method. You can also implement your own locator strategy to support more complex locator logic.

## Prerequisites

Before running the test, ensure that the following software is installed on the target machine:

1. **JDK**: Ensure that Java 11 or higher is installed on the machine.
2. **Git**: Needed to clone the project repository.
3. **Chrome Browser**: Ensure Chrome browser is installed on the machine where the test will run.
4. **IntelliJ IDEA** (Optional): You can use IntelliJ to open and work with the project as a Maven project.

## Setup and Execution

To build and execute the test automation solution, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/braimanm/test-lab-example-playwright.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
    - Change the directory to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd test-lab-example-playwright
    ```

3. **Build the Solution**:
   - Execute the following command to build the solution:

    ```bash title="For Linux/macOS:"
    ./mvnw clean package
    ```

    ```bash title="For Windows:"
    mvnw.cmd clean package
    ```

4. **Execute the Tests**:
   - After the build is complete, execute the tests by running:

    ```bash
     java -jar target/example.jar
    ```

## Test Execution Details

- The test will launch **five instances of the Chrome browser** and run **five different test cases in parallel**.
- Upon completion of the test execution, a detailed <a href="/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**report**</a> with the results will be automatically launched in your default web browser.

## Side-by-Side Comparison: Selenium vs. Playwright

In the following examples, the only difference is that the **@FindBy** annotation used in __Selenium__ has been replaced with the **@Locate** annotation for __Playwright__.
