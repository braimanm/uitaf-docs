# Prerequisites

To effectively utilize UITAF for your test automation projects, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**

    - **IntelliJ IDEA:** UITAF is optimized for development within the IntelliJ IDEA environment. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of IntelliJ IDEA to take full advantage of the framework's features and capabilities.
    - **IDE Configuration:** Make sure to configure your IDE to support Maven-based projects, enabling seamless project management and build automation.

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**

    - **Java 8 SDK:** UITAF is built to be compatible with Java 8. Ensure that the Java 8 SDK is properly installed and configured on your development machine. This version of the JDK provides the necessary runtime environment and development tools required for compiling, debugging, and running UITAF-based test scripts.

3. **Build Automation Tool:**

    - **Apache Maven:** UITAF utilizes Maven for project management and build automation. Maven simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, building project artifacts, and running tests.
        - **Command-Line Maven:** If you prefer working with the command line, ensure that the latest version of Maven is installed and accessible from your system's PATH.
        - **IDE Integration:** IntelliJ IDEA provides integrated support for Maven, allowing you to execute Maven goals directly from the IDE, which can be particularly useful for managing dependencies and running builds within your development environment.

4. **Version Control System (Optional):**

    - **Git:** Although optional, it is highly recommended to use a version control system like Git for managing your UITAF-based test projects. This allows for better collaboration, version tracking, and code management. Ensure that Git is installed and configured on your machine if you plan to collaborate on UITAF projects or contribute to the UITAF repository.
