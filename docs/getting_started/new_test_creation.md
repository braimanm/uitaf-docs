# Creating New Test Project

The easiest way to create a new test project is to use an example test project hosted on a GitHub repository. Simply clone [**test-lab-example**](https://github.com/braimanm/test-lab-example) and modify the content to suit your needs. You can also remove all the unnecessary files, keeping only the folder structure, the pom.xml file, the test.properties file, and the environments.xml file, and then build your test logic classes, datasets, and test suites from the ground up.

:::note
To clone the example project, use the following command:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/braimanm/test-lab-example.git
```
